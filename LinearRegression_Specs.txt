##Download the file 2020.csv from Blackboard into your working directory.
##I will have this file downloaded in my working directory, so do not worry about adding extra folder information.
###Evaluate the dataset for missing data and for numerical data types.
##Place a command to remove all variables from your environment at the very beginning of your script
###For each model, include the following:
###a. Your final model equation
###b. An interpretation of important output statistics from the regression including:
## your overall model test and whether it was statistically significant,
## the R-squared/adjusted R squared in comments,
## the results of the hypothesis test and an interpretation as to what it means.  

#####c. Model diagnostics including statistics and visualizations:
#- Assess linearity of each model
#- Assess normality of residual distribution for each model
#- Assess independence of errors for each model
#- Assess heteroskedasticity for each model
#- Determine if there any outliers for each model?
##if outliers are present, name the most problematic outlier row(s) found in the initial model assessment in the comments.
##Run the model with/without the most problematic outlier(s) to see if the model improves.
##give a rationale for why you should keep the outliers or remove them from the interpretation of the model.


##Model 1. Does GDP.per.capita predict Happiness?
##Test GDP.per.capita as the X variable, and Happiness as the Y variable.
##Save the model as lmhappy

##Model 2. Does Perceptions.of.corruption predict Happiness?
##Test Perceptions.of.corruption as the X variable, and Happiness as the Y variable.
##Save the model as lmcorrupt

##Model 3. Does Generosity predict Happiness?
##Test Generosity as the X variable, and Happiness as the Y variable.
##Save the model as lmgenerosity
